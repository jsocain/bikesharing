## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.

- 81% of users are paid subscribers to the bike service. 19% are occasioanl customers.
- Peak riding hours are between 7:00 AM and 9:00 PM, with the most traffic occuring between 7:00 AM - 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM - 9:00 PM. 
- Most bike trips last less than 30 minutes with most lasting only 5 minutes.
- The biggest group of users are male subscribers.

Two additional visualizations that I would perform with the given dataset would be to determine at the age group of the most common customer and try to figure out the directions riders are traveling per time of day.
